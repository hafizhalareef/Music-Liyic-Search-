  Cinta tak di sini lagi, kau telah berpaling

  Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
  Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu
  Masih adakah cahaya rindumu
  Yang dulu selalu cerminkan hatimu
  Aku takkan bisa menghapus dirimu
  Meski kulihat kini kau di seberang sana
  Biarkan aku menjaga perasaan ini
  Menjaga segenap cinta yang telah kau beri
  Engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi
  Kau menjauh, aku takkan jauh
  Sebenarnya diriku masih mengharapkanmu

  Aku tetap sendiri menjaga hati
  Engkau pergi, aku takkan pergi

  Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
  Faster than the wind<br>
  Passionate as sin<br>
  Ending so suddenly<br>
  Loving him is like<br>
  Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
  Like the colors in autumn, so bright<br>
  Just before they lose it all<br>
  Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
  Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
  Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
  But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>

  Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>

  Touching him was like<br>
  Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you<br>
  Memorizing him was as<br>
  Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song<br>
  Fighting with him was like<br>
  Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer<br>
  Regretting him was like<br>
  Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong<br>
  Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
  Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
  Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
  But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>

  Burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  (Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  Remembering him comes in flashbacks<br>
  And echoes<br>
  Tell myself it's time now<br>
  Gotta let go<br>
  But moving on from him is impossible<br>
  When I still see it all in my head<br>
  In burning red<br>
  Burning it was red<br>
  Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
  Missing him was dark grey, all alone<br>
  Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
  'Cause loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  Yeah, yeah, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  Oh, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  (Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  Comes back to me, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>
  Yeah, yeah (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)<br>

  I close my eyes and the flashback starts
  I'm standin' there
  On a balcony in summer air
  See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
  See you make your way through the crowd
  And say, Hello
  Little did I know
  That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
  And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
  And I was cryin' on the staircase
  Beggin' you, Please don't go,  and I said
  Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
  I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
  You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
  It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes
  So I sneak out to the garden to see you
  We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
  So close your eyes
  Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
  'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
  And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
  But you were everything to me
  I was beggin' you, Please don't go, and I said
  Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
  I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
  You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
  It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes
  Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
  This love is difficult, but it's real
  Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
  It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes
  Oh, oh
  I got tired of waiting
  Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
  My faith in you was fading
  When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
  Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
  I keep waiting for you, but you never come
  Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
  He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
  And said, Marry me, Juliet
  You'll never have to be alone
  I love you and that's all I really know
  I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
  It's a love story, baby, just say, Yes
  Oh, oh, oh
  Oh, oh, oh, oh

  Comes out just when you need it to

  Stupid girl,
  I should have known, I should have known
  That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
  I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
  Lead her up the stairwell
  This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
  I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
  Now it's too late for you
  And your white horse, to come around
  Maybe I was naive,
  Got lost in your eyes
  And never really had a chance
  My mistake I didn't know to be in love
  You had to fight to have the upper hand
  I had so many dreams
  About you and me
  Happy endings
  Now I know
  I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
  I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
  Lead her up the stairwell
  This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
  I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
  Now it's too late for you
  And your white horse, to come around
  And there you are on your knees,
  Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
  Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
  'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
  I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
  This is a big world, that was a small town
  There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
  And its too late for you and your white horse
  Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
  Try and catch me now
  Oh, it's too late

  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
  I wish nothing but the best for you, too
  Don't forget me,  I beg
  I remember you said
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
  Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
  You know how the time flies
  Only yesterday was the time of our lives
  We were born and raised in a summer haze
  Bound by the surprise of our glory days

  Nothing compares, no worries or cares
  Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
  Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you
